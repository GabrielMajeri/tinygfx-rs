# Tiny graphics demos in Rust

## Description

This is my Rust implementation of [Dmitry Sokolov][ssloy]'s [courses][tinycourses]
on how to write your own [raytracer][tinyraytracer], [explosion effect][tinykaboom],
[raycaster][tinyraycaster] and [software rasterizer][tinyrenderer].

Additional information related to how to computer graphics comes from
[Scratchapixel's][scratchapixel] excellent articles.
